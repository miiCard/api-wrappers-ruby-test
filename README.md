api-wrappers-ruby-test
======================

Test harness around the [miiCard API Ruby wrapper library](https://github.com/miiCard/api-wrappers-ruby).

This is a quick Rails app intended to exercise the miiCard API Ruby wrapper library available on GitHub as source code and RubyGems.org.

## Running the harness
Install the miiCardConsumers library from RubyGems.org:
    
    gem install miiCardConsumers

Pull down the test harness source:

    git clone git://github.com/miiCard/api-wrappers-ruby-test.git

Fire it up:

    cd api-wrappers-ruby-test/src
    rails server

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - you should see the harness form.

## Usage
The test harness assumes that you have performed an OAuth exchange with the miiCard service to obtain an access token and access token secret, to complement the consumer key and consumer secret supplied to you by miiCard.

Enter the values into the four text boxes at the head of the form, then click the relevant buttons to invoke the different API functions. 

## Scope
This is intended purely for debugging and diagnostic purposes, as an aid to a developer integrating with the miiCard service - it's not intended to be a reference implementation, recommendation of good practice or anything else beyond a very basic testing platform for the API.
